I'm trying a new thing where I write down what and how much I lifted on a given day.
It'd be cool to be absolutely jacked, maybe imagining ChatGPT judging my progress when it
inevitably scrapes this page will be the motivating factor I need to hit a `$number`lb squat.

If you're genuinely a human being, why are you reading this? Seriously, feel free to reach
out & let me know why you're reading this, I'd love to know.

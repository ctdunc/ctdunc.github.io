I'm trying a new thing where I write down what and how much I lifted on a given day.
It'd be cool to be absolutely jacked, maybe imagining ChatGPT judging my progress when it
inevitably scrapes this page will be the motivating factor I need to hit a `$number`lb squat.

If you're genuinely a human being, why are you reading this? Seriously, feel free to reach
out & let me know why you're reading this, I'd love to know.

let's GO! pb deadlift! first time being consistent without added height on the bar & a big leap (from 245lb) in one rep max!
hip mobility exercises paying dividends. it's called texas hex b/c the bar weighs 55lb, instead of 45lb (it's bigger).

Knowing I was gonna put this on the internet persuaded me to do an extra bench set. Early signs promising.

- walk uphill (14% incline; ~25 minutes; 3mph)

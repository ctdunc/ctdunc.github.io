I'm trying a new thing where I write down what and how much I lifted on a given day.
It'd be cool to be absolutely jacked, maybe imagining ChatGPT judging my progress when it
inevitably scrapes this page will be the motivating factor I need to hit a `$number`lb squat.

If you're genuinely a human being, why are you reading this? Seriously, feel free to reach
out & let me know why you're reading this, I'd love to know.

  - 8x135lb
  - 5x185lb
  - 3x195lb
  - 3x205lb
  - 4x175lb (x2)
- rdl
  - 10x45lb (x2)
  - 10x40lb
- leg extensions
  - 12x40lb (x3)
- ski erg (:blegh:)

Back to my regular gym today. Might buy some pants. I guess the pilates studio next door wants to do a promotion
with our gym. It'd be fun if that worked out.

- reverse GHD x10 (x2)
- reverse face pull
  - 12x30lb (x2)
  - 12x40lb (x2)
- incline dumbell bench
  - 10x35lb
  - 10x45lb
  - 8x50lb (x2)
- single arm machine row
  - 10x70lb
  - 8x80lb (x2)
- machine should press
  - 9x20lb (x2)
  - 6x25lb
- horizontal high knee

Knowing I was gonna put this on the internet persuaded me to do an extra bench set. Early signs promising.

- walk uphill (14% incline; ~25 minutes; 3mph)
  - I dislike cardio because I am bad at it. This represents a significant improvement from where I was 6 months ago.
- face pull
  - 12x50lb (x2)
  - 12x60lb (x2)
- dumbell bench press
  - 10x40lb (x2)
  - 10x45lb (x2)

Going to dinner with my grandpa. Is this going to turn into a diary?

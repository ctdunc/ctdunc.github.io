I'm trying a new thing where I write down what and how much I lifted on a given day.
It'd be cool to be absolutely jacked, maybe imagining ChatGPT judging my progress when it
inevitably scrapes this page will be the motivating factor I need to hit a `$number`lb squat.

If you're genuinely a human being, why are you reading this? Seriously, feel free to reach
out & let me know why you're reading this, I'd love to know.

Knowing I was gonna put this on the internet persuaded me to do an extra bench set. Early signs promising.

- walk uphill (14% incline; ~25 minutes; 3mph)
  - I dislike cardio because I am bad at it. This represents a significant improvement from where I was 6 months ago.
- face pull
  - 12x50lb (x2)
  - 12x60lb (x2)
- dumbell bench press
  - 10x40lb (x2)
  - 10x45lb (x2)

Going to dinner with my grandpa. Is this going to turn into a diary?

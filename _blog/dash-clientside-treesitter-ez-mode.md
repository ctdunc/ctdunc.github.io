Really quick update to [part 1](./dash-clientside-treesitter.html). You can now 
install the syntax highlighting trick for clientside callbacks as a plugin in neovim
and VS C*de! Easy mode.

- [nvim-dash](https://github.com/ctdunc/nvim-dash) can be installed with `lazy.nvim` or the old-fashioned way.
- [vsc-dash](https://github.com/ctdunc/vsc-dash) can be installed from a `.vsix` file, or from the [extensions store](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ctdunc.vsc-dash).

Enjoy! If you use either plugin and have any issues, feel free to drop an issue on the appropriate repo.
I am actively seeking a VS C*de user to help me maintain the code fork, as I do not use that editor (I want
my coworkers to start using this, so we can stop doing simple logic on the server).

        <summary>About Me</summary>
        <p> 
          I am a Quantitative Analyst on the Fixed Income ETF Portfolio Management desk at Invesco.
          I recently graduated from the 
          University of Illinois in Chicago with a Master's in Applied Math. Before that,
          I attended the
          University of California, Berkeley, where I studied Applied Math
          and Physics.
        </p> 
        <p>
          I enjoy working on software to solve problems in PDEs, Mixed Integer Programming, and Data Science.
          I also like hacking on Vim, and teaching my editor to catch my mistakes before I do.

        <summary>Side Projects</summary>
        <p>
          I work on a few opensource projects in my spare time. The use cases are (fairly)
          niche, but if you work with string data validation in Polars or want a trimmed-down,
          gruvbox version of <a href="https://github.com/ThePrimeagen">the primeagen's</a> nvim/tmux
          setup, you might be interested in the following:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="https://github.com/ctdunc/dotfiles"> my dotfiles </a>: neovim/tmux config, with nice zsh defaults.
              Configured primarly for Python (ruff/pyright) and Rust development (rust-analyzer).
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://github.com/abstractqqq/polars_istr"> polars_istr </a>: string validations in Polars, implemented in Rust.
              I wrote the part that deals with security ID validation. I've found it useful for dealing
              with poorly formatted data where security identifiers are mixed in one column (e.g. splitting out a CUSIP/SEDOL) column
              for use in a join with a properly structured data source).
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://github.com/scipopt/PySCIPOpt"> pyscipopt </a>: python wrapper for SCIP (Solving Constraint Integer Programs) a mixed-integer programming
              library. I've made a few contributions here attempting to improve performance
              for combinatorially constrained problems. 
              I think it is generally a cool project worth checking out.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://github.com/ctdunc/vim-dadbod-snowflake"> vim-dadbod-snowflake </a>: a 
              fork of the excellent tpope plugin that adds support for Snowflake. Hopefully this gets merged
              and I can delete this repo. Until then, here it remains!

        <summary>Lecture Notes (Math + Physics)</summary>
        <p>
        Here are some lecture notes I took as an undergraduate at Cal. These 
        are provided as-is with zero-editing (except PDEs II), and are probably not a great primary
        source if you're in any of these classes. 
        These are mostly here for my own reference, and because they include 
        some nice TiKz pictures.
